### Setting up project

First, change to root of project and let composer install project by issuing following command in terminal:

```
composer install
```

Then issuing following command to update package information and recompile:

```
composer update
```

Wait until composer process completed, and copy your database into `/storage/app` since it's been ignore by git.

Note that if database isn't `database.sqlite`, rename it or modify path of database which locate at `/config/database.php`

```php
     'connections' => [

        'sqlite' => [
            'driver'   => 'sqlite',
            'database' => storage_path('app/database.sqlite'),
            'prefix'   => '',
        ],
        ...
```

Since `.env` has been ignored by git by default, cpoy `.env.example` as `.env`

then execute `php artisan key:generate` in terminal

For more detail, take a look at [Laravel Documentation](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/installation#environment-configuration).

Don't forget to point entrance to `/public`, and we are finally good to go : )
